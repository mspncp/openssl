=head1 DESCRIPTION

ossl_cmp_log_parse_metadata() parses the given message buffer C<buf> populated
by L<OSSL_CMP_log()> etc.
according to the pattern OSSL_CMP_LOG_START#level ": %s\n", filling in
the variable pointed to by C<level> with the severity level or -1,
the variable pointed to by C<func> with the function name string or NULL,
the variable pointed to by C<file> with the file name string or NULL, and
the variable pointed to by C<line> with the line number or -1.
Any string returned via C<*func> and C<*file> must be freeed by the caller.

ossl_cmp_x509_extensions_dup() copies a list of X.509 v3 extensions.

ossl_cmp_asn1_octet_string_set1() frees any previous value of the variable
referenced via the C<tgt> argument and assigns either a copy of
the ASN1_OCTET_STRING given as the C<src> argument or C<NULL>.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on error.

ossl_cmp_asn1_octet_string_set1_bytes() frees any previous value of the variable
referenced via the C<tgt> argument and assigns either a copy of the given byte
string (with the given length) or NULL. It returns 1 on success, 0 on error.

ossl_cmp_build_cert_chain() builds up the certificate chain of cert as high up
as possible using the given X509_STORE containing all possible intermediate
certificates and optionally the (possible) trust anchor(s).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ossl_cmp_log_parse_metadata() returns the pointer to the
OSSL_CMP_LOG_PREFIX if found in the buffer, else the beginning of the buffer.

ossl_cmp_x509_extensions_dup()
returns NULL in case the input list is NULL and on error.

ossl_cmp_build_cert_chain()
returns NULL on error, else a pointer to a stack of (up_ref'ed) certificates
containing the EE certificate given in the function arguments (cert)
and all intermediate certificates up the chain toward the trust anchor.
The (self-signed) trust anchor is not included.

All other functions return 1 on success, 0 on error.
